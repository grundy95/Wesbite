I am a data scientist at Peak where I predominately work with manufacturing companies on pricing projects to deliver end-to-end ML pipelines that improve decision making & deliver measurable value. In 2021, I completed my PhD at the STOR-i Doctoral Training Centre at Lancaster University. My PhD was in partnership with Royal Mail and focused on changepoint detection in time series data. Through my work I aim to build effective statistical & ML methodology that is utilised and has an impact in the real world.

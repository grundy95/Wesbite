I am a 3rd year PhD student at the STOR-i Doctoral Training Centre at Lancaster University. My PhD is in partnership with Royal Mail and focuses on changepoint detection in time series data. My research aims to develop effective statistical methodology that has an impact in the real world.

Beyond solving the worlds statistical problems, I'm a keen fell-runner, horse rider and football enthusiast. In the ideal world, every weekend would be spent camping in the Lakes!

First things first, the word changepoint can be spelt in many different ways (changepoint, change-point or change point) and if your looking in the economic literature they can also be called structural breaks - don‚Äôt be confused these are all describing the exact same thing!\nChangepoint analysis is exactly what it says on the tin; it involves looking for points of change in ordered data. The most common type of ordered data is time series data where data is collected over time. The aim of changepoint analysis is then to identify points in time where the structure of the data has changed. Okay, so what does a changepoint look like? The plot below shows the most common type of change; a mean change (also known as a level shift).\nLooking at this plot, you would be able to tell me where the changepoint is. So what‚Äôs the point in decades worth of research into a subject area that we can do instantly just by looking at the data? Well, what if I now gave your 10000 time series to look at and asked you to tell me where all the changepoints were? If you were rich enough you could hire 10000 people and get the answers instantly or you could utilize changepoint analysis. I‚Äôm going to assume we want to do the latter.\nSo what we want from our changepoint analysis is to replicate what the human eye can do instantly - spot the change. How does your eye know where the change is though? Well if we break it down you would probaly see the first 500 time points are centered around 0 and the last 500 time points are centered around 2. So what we are noticing is the mean of the time points has changed. This idea forms the basis of the first changepoint method we will look at, the CUmulative SUM (CUSUM).\nCUSUM The basic idea behind the CUSUM method is to split the data at every possible changepoint location (so here every timepoint) and to compare the mean of the data before the split and after the split. The point where the difference between the means is the greatest is the most likely position of the changepoint. We would then check if the difference between the means was large enough to deem a change has occured.\nIn order to define the CUSUM statistic formally we first need some basic notation. Let \\(X_t\\) be our data for \\(t=1,\\ldots,n\\), where \\(n\\) is the length of the data. Let \\(k\\) be the point at which we split the data. The CUSUM test statistic, \\(T\\), at point \\(k\\) is defined as \\[ T(k)=\\sqrt{\\frac{k(n-k)}{n}}\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^kX_t-\\frac{1}{n-k}\\sum\\limits_{t=k+1}^nX_t\\right)\\;.\\]\nNotice, the CUSUM statistic is actually a weighted difference of the means. This is to account for the size of the segment before and after \\(k\\). If we have less data, our estimate of the mean will be poorer and this is accounted for in the weighting.\nSo how does this CUSUM statistic behave with the data shown above? The plot below shows the raw data and the CUSUM statistic at each potential time point.\nWe can see the CUSUM statistic is minimized at the changepoint location. If the data had a mean decrease the CUSUM statistic would be maximised at the changepoint location. Hence, to find the most likely changepoint position we take the value of \\(k\\) that corresponds to the maximimum of the absoulte value fo the CUSUM statistics.\nSo, we have found the most likely changepoint position but how do we know that a changepoint actually occured at that location? There may be no changepoints in the data but the CUSUM statisitc will always return a most likley changepoint position. To determine if a changepoint is detected we need some threshold that the CUSUM statistic must exceed. There is alot of litreture on choosing this threshold but in its simplest form the aim of the threshold is to control the false positive rate, \\(\\alpha\\). By this I mean we want a threhsold such that, if there were no changeoints in the data, the probability of the maximum CUSUM staistic exceeding the threshold would be \\(\\alpha\\). I common choice of false positive rate is \\(\\alpha=0.05\\). Here is not the place to delve to deeply into choosing an appropriate threshold.\nUp till now, we haven‚Äôt placed any assumptions on our data. Many of you will have noticed the data in the plots is Normally distributed but it doesn‚Äôt need to be for the CUSUM to be used. However, if we did know the data generating process then we could use an alternative method, namley the likelihood ratio test.\n Likelihood Ratio Test I‚Äôm going to assume people are familar with likelihoods. If not you can basically treat the liklihood as measuring ‚Äúhow likely is it that the data came from this distirbution‚Äù. In the likelihood ratio test (LRT) we are comparing the liklihood of the whole data to the likelihood that there is a changepoint present.\nLet‚Äôs take the example of Normal data with known unit variance. We want to see if there is a change in mean in the data. The unknown parameter here is the mean so this needs to be estimated and we choose the estimate of the mean that maximises the liklihood. So we want the maximum likelihood estiamtor of the mean (this turns out to be just the traditional mean we are used to for Normal data).\nOkay so how would we go about calculating the LRT statistic for our Normal data with unit varaince. Well, first we need the likelihood of the whole data, \\[ L(\\mu)=\\prod\\limits_{t=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp{-\\frac{(x_t-\\mu)^2}{2}} \\] We want to maximise this with respect to \\(\\mu\\). Here we would get \\(\\hat{\\mu}=\\bar{x}\\). Now we need the likelihood of the data assuming there is a change at some location. \\[ L(\\mu_1, \\mu_2, k)=\\prod\\limits_{t=1}^k\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp{-\\frac{(x_t-\\mu_1)^2}{2}}\\prod\\limits_{t=k+1}^n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp{-\\frac{(x_t-\\mu_2)^2}{2}} \\] Here we want to maximise this over \\(\\mu_1\\), \\(\\mu_2\\) and \\(k\\). This can be done similarly to the CUSUM procedure. We let \\(k\\) take every position in the time series sequesntially, caluclate the mean before and after, and see which value of \\(k\\) maximises the likelihood.\nNow we have our likelihhod for the whole data assuming no change, \\(L_1(\\hat{\\mu})\\), and the likelihood of the data assuming a change, \\(L_2(\\hat{\\mu}_1, \\hat{\\mu}_2, \\hat{k})\\). We can caluclate the LRT statistic as \\[ \\text{LRT}=-2\\log\\left(\\frac{L_1(\\hat{\\mu})}{L_2(\\hat{\\mu}_1, \\hat{\\mu}_2, \\hat{k}} \\] Similarly, to the CUSUM staistic we then need to compare this to some threshold to see if a changepoint has occured. If it exceeds this threshold then we deem the changepoint to have occured at \\(\\hat{k}\\).\n  This is an R Markdown document.

The aim is to accurately and efficiently detect changepoints in time series data when both the number of time points and dimensions grow large. Existing methods typically aggregate or project the data to a smaller number of dimensions, usually one. We present a high-dimensional changepoint detection method that takes inspiration from geometry to map a high-dimensional time series to two dimensions. We show theoretically and through simulation that if the input series is Gaussian, then the mappings preserve the Gaussianity of the data. Applying univariate changepoint detection methods to both mapped series allows the detection of changepoints that correspond to changes in the mean and variance of the original time series. We demonstrate that this approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art multivariate changepoint methods in terms of accuracy of detected changepoints and computational efficiency. We conclude with applications from genetics and finance.","tags":null,"title":"High-dimensional changepoint detection via a geometrically inspired mapping","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
